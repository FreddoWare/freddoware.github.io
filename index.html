                        My name is Freddo, (spoiler alert it's not my real name), and I'm a Computer Science student and fan of Games. Sources say I am also a small-time Twitch and YouTube streamer. I stream mainly my Game Developer Journey as well as some gaming sometimes. This is a prototype of my webpage so don't judge the website too too much!

                        I am currently working on my first game called How I Became A Hero. It's gonna be a dungeon crawler, rogue-like, platformer concoction, that borrows elements from many games, but most notably Dungreed. (I know the schedule is empty I'll fix it I promise.)
